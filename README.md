# Cashier

Cashier is a no-code transaction builder for non-technical users, such as marketers, solopreneurs, or consumers.

With Cashier, users can build and share payment, donation, tip, airdrop, swap, etc in minutes from their phone. Its quick, easy, and cheap. For custom needs, Cashier also supports flexible transaction flows and gating rules. Users can focus on their transaction needs rather than implementation.

Video: Introducing Cashier!

# Introduction

On a user level, Cashier is about providing a no-code transaction builder for non-technical users. The aim is to build a vast library of transaction templates that users can pick from and use quickly and easily.

Technically, Cashier is all about flexibly configuring and executing different types of transactions. Cashier does this by orchestrating different types of transactions. Following is how it works:

-   Each transaction is defined by what type of transfers it makes (i.e. a tip link will transfer an asset from the transaction link to the user wallet). Such behaviors for each transaction / link type is pre-configured in link service.
-   The frontend collects user input on what type of assets the users want to use in the transactions.
-   The transaction manager generates blockchain level requests and executes the transactions. Link to wallet transactions are executed on the backend while wallet to link transactions are executed by triggering the connected wallet.

# Installation

## Prerequisites

-   [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
-   [DFX](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/building-apps/getting-started/install)
-   [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en)

## Install

`frontend`

```bash
// install all dependecies
npm install

// run local
npm start
```

`cashier_backend`

```bash
make build-backend
```

`token_storage`

```bash
make build-token-storage
```

# Usage

Using Cashier is easy. Start by going to cashierapp.io and log in with Internet Identity. We will support more login options going forward.

Create a transaction in 3 easy steps:

-   Choose transaction type.
-   select assets to use in the transaction.
-   Generate the transaction.

And share the link for others to use.

The link user can use the link in following steps:

-   tap on link to open the transaction page.
-   Pick a wallet to transact with.
-   Execute the transaction.

# Roadmap

âœ… Done

-   Link service foundation
-   Transaction manager foundation
-   Link and user state machines
